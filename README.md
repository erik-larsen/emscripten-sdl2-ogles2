# emscripten-sdl2-ogles2
*C++/SDL2/OpenGLES2 to Javascript/WebGL using Emscripten*

This project is a collection of C++/SDL2/OpenGL samples that run in the browser via Emscripten.  These samples can serve as building blocks to aid in porting C++ graphics apps to the browser.

The long-term goal with this work is to preserve old graphics demos, particularly those developed in the 1990s by Silicon Graphics.  This work is inspired in part by the [preservation of classic arcade games in the browser](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade), which also utilizes Emscripten.


## Samples

### [Run Hello Triangle](https://erik-larsen.github.io/emscripten-sdl2-ogles2/hello_triangle.html)

![Hello Triangle](media/hello_triangle.png)

Demonstrates a colorful triangle using shaders, with support for mouse and touch input:
 * Pan with left mouse or finger drag on mobile.
 * Zoom with mouse wheel or pinch gesture on mobile.

### [Run Hello Texture](https://erik-larsen.github.io/emscripten-sdl2-ogles2/hello_texture.html)

![Hello Texture](media/hello_texture.png)

Demonstrates a textured triangle, using SDL to load an image from a file.

### [Run Hello Text](https://erik-larsen.github.io/emscripten-sdl2-ogles2/hello_text_ttf.html)

![Hello Text](media/hello_text_ttf.png)

Demonstrates TrueType text, using SDL to render a string into a texture and apply it to a quad.

### [Run Hello Texture Atlas](https://erik-larsen.github.io/emscripten-sdl2-ogles2/hello_text_txf.html)

![Hello Texture Atlas](media/hello_text_txf.png)

Demonstrates Texfont text, loading a font texture atlas from a .txf file and applying it to a quad. 

## Motivation

### Why Emscripten?  

Running an app in the browser is the ultimate convenience for the user - no manual download nor install is necessary and it will run on desktop, tablet, and phone.  Better to have Emscripten do the work to produce optimal Javascript/WASM, than doing the boring and error-prone work of hand porting C++ code.  Some porting will still be necessary, but only to massage the code into cross-platform C++.


### Why SDL2? 

These demos require OS-dependent stuff (keyboard, mouse, touch, text, audio, networking, etc.). SDL provides a cross-platform library to access this, and Emscripten supports SDL.


### Why OpenGLES2?  

These demos require GPU accelerated graphics, and using the GPU in the browser is done via WebGL.  And getting WebGL generated by Emscripten is done via OpenGLES 2.
